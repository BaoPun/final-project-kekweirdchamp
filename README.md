This is CS 492 Final Project focusing on League of Legends.

Enter a summoner (preset is from NA).
If that summoner is in a SUMMONERS RIFT (preset) game, then list out it and 9 other players.

On each layout, the user is able to see ALL of the 9 other players that are in the same game as the searched user.  Each player consists of a champion icon to see what champion is being played, as well as their summoner names color coded in either blue or red to determine which side they're playing on.

The default server is NA, but can be changed in user preferences.

After clicking on the image, it'll redirect the user to a u.gg website corresponding to that champion.
After clicking anywhere else on the Recycler view, it'll redirect to that summoner's op.gg website.

One final application currently in progress:
Create a login authenticator.  If the user is able to login successfully on Riot API, then they are able to save their favorite summoners.
  
DEVELOPERS: CREATE A FILE CALLED apikey.properties AND THEN ADD YOUR API KEY ON THERE.
