This is CS 492 Final Project focusing on League of Legends.

Enter a summoner (preset is from NA).
If that summoner is in a SUMMONERS RIFT (preset) game, then list out it and 9 other players.

On each layout, the user is able to see ALL of the 9 other players that are in the same game as the searched user.  Each player consists of a champion icon to see what champion is being played, as well as their summoner names color coded in either blue or red to determine which side they're playing on.

The default server is NA, but can be changed in user preferences.

After clicking on the image, it'll redirect the user to a u.gg website corresponding to that champion.
After clicking anywhere else on the Recycler view, it'll redirect to that summoner's op.gg website.

Some animations are also added to have results fade in upon a successful search.

User preferences are added to query between different regions.  Due to limitations with Riot's API, we cannot see China's servers.
  
DEVELOPERS: CREATE A FILE CALLED apikey.properties AND THEN ADD YOUR API KEY ON THERE.
