This is CS 492 Final Project focusing on League of Legends.

Enter a summoner (preset is from NA).
If that summoner is in a SUMMONERS RIFT (preset) game, then list out it and 9 other players.

By clicking on each player involved in the live game, the user will be able to see what champion they are playing
  what side are they playing on, and what rank they are.
Also within that specific intent, the user will either be able to go to op.gg to look at the user or go to u.gg to look at what champion
  they are playing.
  
Currently a lot of work needs to be done.
DEVELOPERS: CREATE A FILE CALLED apikey.properties AND THEN ADD YOUR API KEY ON THERE.
